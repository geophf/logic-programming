# QUANTA in PYTHON! YUS!
 
First, install python. Then set up your virtual environment.

```bash
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
```

If you're using a windows computer, ... I mean: how can you even face yourself?

Then install `numpy` and the quantum kit, `qiskit`.

```bash
$ pip install numpy
$ pip install qiskit
```

That'll take a while.

*... a while later, hm, hm, hm ...*

Then do the [qiskit quantum tutorials](https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/circuits/1_getting_started_with_qiskit.html). YAY!
