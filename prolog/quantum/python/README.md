# QUANTA in PYTHON! YUS!
 
First, install python. Then set up your virtual environment.

```bash
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
```

If you're using a windows computer, ... I mean: how can you even face yourself?

Then install `numpy` and the quantum kit, `qiskit`.

```bash
$ pip install numpy
$ pip install qiskit
```

That'll take a while.

*... a while later, hm, hm, hm ...*

Now we need to install the plotting software:

```bash
$ pip install matplotlib
```

Then do the [qiskit quantum tutorials](https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/circuits/1_getting_started_with_qiskit.html). YAY!

To run the demos:

`$ python qubit01.py`

and

``$ python qubit02.py `cat my_token.txt` ibmq_16_melbourne``

to run the second deom on melbourne's quantum computer. N.b.: it takes 3-4
minutes to run that demo.
