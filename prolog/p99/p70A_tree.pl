/*
P70 (**) Tree construction from a node string

We suppose that the nodes of a multiway tree contain single characters. In the 
depth-first order sequence of its nodes, a special character ^ has been 
inserted whenever, during the tree traversal, the move is a backtrack to the 
previous level.

By this rule, the tree in the figure below is represented as: afg^^c^bd^e^^^

Define the syntax of the string and write a predicate tree(String,Tree) to 
construct the Tree when the String is given. Work with atoms (instead of 
strings). Make your predicate work in both directions. [ed: no]

    (a)
   / | \
(f) (c) (b)
 |     /   \
(g) (d)     (e)

tree(Atom, t(H, Nodes)) :-
   name(Atom, [H|T]),
   parse_tree(T, Nodes)
